# Keyless DSSE fixtures

`generator.intoto.jsonl` is a real provenance envelope from the original
slsa-verifier's test data (Apache-2.0,
https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier): a DSSE envelope signed
keyless by the slsa-github-generator's Go builder, carrying its Fulcio
certificate in the non-standard `cert` signature field.
`rekor-response.json` is its Rekor SearchLogQuery response, frozen from
rekor.sigstore.dev so tests verify the real log entry offline.
